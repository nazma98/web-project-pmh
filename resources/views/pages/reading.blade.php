        Our life in this world is very short but we spend our most of time in anxiety,depression.frustration,heart break and many
        other problems.Absorbing negitivity within youself is the root cause of depression.In our life if we change the aspect of our view we
        can realize that life is not only about run after the material things,life has also other purpose.
