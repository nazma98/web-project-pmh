    Volunteering is a voluntary act of an individual or group freely <br>
    giving time and labour for community service.<br>
    
     We define volunteering as any activity that involves spending <br>
     time, unpaid, doing something that aims to benefit the environment or someone (individuals or groups)<br>
      other than, or in addition to, close relatives. ...
      Everyone has the right to volunteer and volunteering can have significant benefits for individuals.</i>

    <h1 style="color:darkseagreen"><b>Why should you do Volunteering ?</b></h1>
    <p style="color:crimson"><i>People volunteer because it gives them an outlet to express an interest or passion, or to feel a <br>
      sense of connection to their community. It’s a sure-fire way to meet like-minded people and make friends,
      <br> and it provides great work-life balance. Of course,
       there’s also the ‘feel good’ aspect that most people experience<br>
        when they know they’re helping someone out.Helping others gives our mind a kind of satisfaction. </i></p><br>

  Choose a volunteer project with children if you have an abundance of kindness and patience, coupled <br>
  with a  determination to see all young people succeed.<br> 
  Volunteering with children  includes teach them about their basic needs,basic learning,
  sanitation,social rights and about their career etc.You can also work in different slums where most of the<br>
  children are uneducated and unhealthy.A small step of your can make their life better.

  Although you can volunteer directly with children, for ethical reasons it’s important to steer clear of<br>
   orphanage volunteering. In countries around the world, children are trafficked into orphanages 
   that might accept volunteers or international tourists.<br> 
  
  Fee-paying volunteers and tourists can unknowingly bring income and support to these organisations,<br>
   often at the expense of the children involved. If you truly wish to aid the children of the world, 
   choose volunteer organisations wisely.Volunteering with children can make you realize <br>
   how your small involvement can make someone's life better.<br>

  aged people become like children when they grow old.<br>
  They can not do their work and can not take care of themselves.<br>
   Old age is viewed as an unavoidable, undesirable and problem ridden phase of life.<br>
   They feel unwanted,ignored and most importantly<br>
  They can not talk about their problem or share their problem with their children.<br>
  Aged people are send to old aged home because their children are unableto 
   take care of them as  they remain busy with their own life.<br>
   This creates a mental  truma and depression among the old people.<br>
  As a volunteer you can go any old aged home and spend time with the eldery people<br>
  This can  help them to share their feelings,thoughts ,emotions,loves with you
   and also can help you to bring some mental peache to your mind.<br>
